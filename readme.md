###JavaScript: Dynamic Elements and Events

####Overview
Understanding how to bind and handle events is a core part of being a web developer. This challenge tasks you to take a reasonably well factored Javascript application and extend it to include event bindings. Some of the good practices you'll see in the provided code are:

-  Using templates from the HTML to add elements.
-  Using functions to scope variables (i.e. todoTemplate is accessible within buildTodo, but not in the global scope. Why?)
-  Using functions to do only one thing (i.e. building the Todo DOM Element vs building the element and adding it to the list)
-  This should provide you with a solid foundation to complete the remaining features.


####Core
This challenge requires you to manipulate objects that have been added dynamically. You may want to brush up on Event Delegation.

#####Objectives
Download the todo skeleton and modify it so:

-  A todo may be added to the page.
-  A todo may be marked as complete.
-  A todo may be removed from the page.
(Hint: Create named functions and bind them to the appropriate buttons)
